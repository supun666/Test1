<big> paragraph is a group of sentences that develop a single main idea.<br> 
A well-structured paragraph
 typically includes a topic sentence, supporting sentences, and a concluding<br> 
 sentence. For example,
 a paragraph about the benefits of exercise might begin with a topic sentence <br> 
 stating that exercise
 improves physical and mental health, then provide supporting sentences detailing<br> 
 specific benefits 
like increased cardiovascular health and reduced stress, and conclude with a<br>  
sentence summarizing the 
overall positive impact of exercise.

A paragraph is like a miniature essay
Just like an essay, a paragraph contains three parts;

An introduction > topic sentence

A body > body sentences

A conclusion > concluding sentence.

Each paragraph:

Is a distinct section of your writing

Focuses on just one clearly defined idea

Has to be well organised with all sentences relating to each other, and the topic.
